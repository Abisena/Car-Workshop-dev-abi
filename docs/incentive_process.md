# Incentive Process

Incentives reward technicians based on configured job types and rates.

## Configuration

1. Use **Incentive Configuration** to link a job type with an incentive type.
2. Set a fixed or percentage rate, or define tiers for tiered incentives.
3. Upon submission, changes are versioned for auditing purposes.

## Calculation

During billing submission, the incentive utility calculates technician
incentives and logs the results in **Incentive History**.
