# Billing Process

The billing workflow manages how completed work orders are converted into
customer invoices.

## Steps

1. Open a submitted **Work Order** and select **Create → Work Order Billing**.
2. Review the services, parts and external services pulled from the work order.
3. Apply any taxes or discounts and verify the computed totals.
4. Submit the billing document to generate an accounts receivable entry.

## Notes

- All amounts are validated server‑side to avoid negative values.
- Change tracking is enabled so every update creates a new version record.
