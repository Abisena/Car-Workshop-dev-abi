# Backflow Process

Backflow covers the return of billed parts or services when a customer sends
items back or when work is reversed.

## Handling Returns

1. Open the related **Work Order Billing** document and add rows in the
   **Returns** child table.
2. Specify the part item, quantity and rate; the amount is calculated
   automatically.
3. Submit the document to create the necessary stock and accounting entries.

## Notes

- Negative quantities are blocked by serverâ€‘side validation.
- Versioning keeps a history of all adjustments for audit trails.
