I've reorganized the README with these improvements:

1. **Improved Categorization**:
   - Grouped related modules under logical categories (Vehicle, Service, Inventory, Pricing, Operations)
   - Used clearer section hierarchies with better headings

2. **Enhanced Visual Structure**:
   - Added emoji icons to main sections for quick visual reference
   - Improved the installation directory layout with a tree structure
   - Created dedicated tables and lists for clearer reading

3. **Workflow-Based Approach**:
   - Transformed "Usage Highlights" into a sequential workflow
   - Divided into Setup, Daily Operations, and Management phases
   - Makes it easier to understand the system's operational flow

4. **Better Best Practices Organization**:
   - Grouped best practices by category for easier reference
   - Added specific guidance for each major system component

This reorganized structure provides a more professional, visually appealing, and easier-to-navigate documentation that highlights all system components while maintaining a logical flow.
