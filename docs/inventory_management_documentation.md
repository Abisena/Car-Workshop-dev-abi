## Workflows and Processes

### Physical Inventory Count Process

1. **Create Stock Opname**:
   - Initiate a new count document
   - Specify warehouse to be counted

2. **Scan and Count Items**:
   - Use barcode scanner or camera to identify parts
   - Enter counted quantities
   - Add additional items as needed

3. **Submit the Count**:
   - Review counted items
   - Submit the document to lock counts

4. **Create Adjustment**:
   - Generate a Stock Adjustment from the Opname
   - Review differences between system and counted quantities
   - Submit the adjustment to update inventory

5. **Verification**:
   - System creates appropriate stock entries
   - Inventory is updated to match physical count

### Material Return Process

1. **Create Return Material Document**:
   - Select the source Work Order
   - Specify return warehouse

2. **Add Return Items**:
   - Fetch returnable items automatically
   - Select items to be returned
